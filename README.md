# Crystalrohr: Decentralized Video Captioning Platform

## Overview

Crystalrohr is a decentralised video captioning protocol. Our name embodies our mission: bringing crystal clear understanding to visual content. Rohr (German for "pipe" or "tube") represents our role in channeling visual information to those who can't see it.


With Our Visual Indexing and Sequencing Engine (VISE), we can break down videos frame-by-frame, analysing visual content with audio context. This creates precise timestamps with detailed descriptions, letting blind users navigate exactly to the moments they need or enable anyone search through video content semantically.
